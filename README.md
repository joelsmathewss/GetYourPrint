# PrintReady
PrintReady is a hobby web application I developed to solve the problem of inefficient printing queues at my B.Tech campus store. It streamlines the entire printing process by allowing students to upload documents and track job status online. Concurrently, staff can manage incoming requests from a centralized dashboard.
